The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on an Arkas Lojistik shipment tracking application, starting from a base MVP and iteratively enhancing it based on user feedback. The process began with fixing the visibility of backup/restore buttons. Subsequently, the engineer implemented data deduplication during backup restoration, multi-selection with bulk delete functionality, and a global search feature that ignores month/year filters. UI/UX was improved by adjusting toast notification positions and adding a dark/light theme toggle, followed by a critical fix for text readability in dark mode. Responsive design for mobile and tablet was addressed. A complex authentication system was then introduced, featuring registration, login, password reset, and biometric (WebAuthn) capabilities, initially with email/SMS verification. However, due to user feedback on complexity and non-functional notifications, this authentication was first simplified to direct login/registration, and then completely removed, reverting the application to a direct-access state. The current task involves new feature requests for UI adjustments and data aggregation.

<product_requirements>
The Arkas Lojistik - Nakliye Takip Sistemi is a full-stack application designed to track and manage shipments, initially processing data from an Excel file. The user required a modern, responsive UI (desktop, mobile, tablet) with specific branding (Arkas logo, text styling). Core features included: CRUD operations for shipment records, dynamic dashboard statistics (Toplam Kayıt, Bu Ay, Toplam Tutar), month-based data filtering, adding Boş type and Kod field, persistent user info, and a Sistem comparison column with color-coding. Advanced features included annual PDF export with year selection, and planned cross-platform native application builds. Recent additions focused on data management (backup/restore, duplicate prevention, multi-delete), UI/UX (global search, toast notification positioning, dark/light theme, responsive layout), and a brief, then removed, authentication system.

    -   **Importance**: Lists Python dependencies.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added  for Excel. Added , ,  for authentication, but these might be removable now that auth is gone.
-   , , 
    -   **Importance**: Authentication-related models, utility functions (hashing, JWT), and (mock) notification service.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created for authentication feature, then largely cleared/removed as auth was simplified and then removed.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Main React component managing state, UI, and API calls.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensive modifications:

        -   PDF export,  for user info.
        -   **Added**: Backup/Restore buttons and their logic, duplicate prevention in restore, multi-selection checkboxes and bulk delete, global search, dark/light theme toggle, responsive layout fixes.
        -   **Added then Removed**:  integration, authentication states, handlers,  interceptor, logout button,  component.
-    & 
    -   **Importance**: Global and component CSS, Tailwind directives.
    -   **Changes Made**: Custom styling for branding, responsive adjustments, custom CSS variables, sticky headers, dark theme specific styles, checkbox border fix.

    -   **Changes Made**:   modified for central, then bottom-middle positioning. Toast animations updated.
-   , , , , , 
    -   **Importance**: Frontend authentication components and wrapper.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created for the authentication feature, then largely removed from the codebase when auth was removed.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Node.js dependencies.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added , , , , , .
-   
    -   **Importance**: Tailwind CSS configuration.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added  breakpoint (480px).

<pending_tasks>
- **Name Shortening Removal**: Prevent user names from shortening on smaller screens.
- **Monthly Totals**: Add monthly total and system general total at the bottom of the display.
- **Deposited Amount Column**: Create a new column/section next to Karşılaştırma for Yatan Tutar (deposited amount).
- **Cross-Platform Native Application Build**: The plan to build , , and  files using Electron and Capacitor has been discussed but not fully executed.
- **GitHub Integration**: Setting up the project on GitHub to facilitate APK builds via GitHub Actions.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on the latest set of user-requested UI/UX and data display improvements. The user explicitly requested three specific changes:
1.  **Prevent name shortening**: When the screen size reduces, the user's name (e.g., Mehmet Yılmaz) should not be shortened.
2.  **Monthly Totals at Bottom**: Display Toplam (Total) and Sistem (System) amounts as general monthly totals at the bottom of the table or display area.
3.  **Yatan Tutar Column**: Add a new column or section next to the Karşılaştırma (Comparison) column where a Yatan Tutar (Deposited Amount) can be input or displayed.

The AI engineer acknowledged these requests and, as the trajectory concluded, had just started implementing the *first* of these tasks: removing the name shortening logic in , specifically targeting the line related to . This indicates the current work is in the very early stages of implementing these three new features, with the focus initially on the name display.

<optional_next_step>
I will continue by removing the name shortening logic in  as per the user's last request.
