The previous AI engineer developed a comprehensive shipment tracking application based on user requirements. The initial phase involved parsing an Excel file, establishing a React frontend with a FastAPI backend, and setting up a MongoDB database. Key user-driven iterations included extensive UI/UX branding (logo, text styling, colors), implementing responsive design for various devices, dynamic dashboard statistics, and interactive data filtering. Critical features like persistent user data via , manual 'Sistem' value input with color-coded comparisons, and a robust PDF export functionality with customizable year ranges were added. The AI also addressed multiple bugs, primarily concerning user data persistence and PDF generation challenges. Towards the end, cross-platform native application (APK/EXE/APP) generation was planned, and the immediate task involves fixing the visibility of backup/restore buttons. The trajectory shows a strong focus on iterative development and user feedback incorporation.

The user required a full-stack application to process and track shipments, initially from an Excel file (). The application, named Arkas Lojistik - Nakliye Takip Sistemi, needed a modern, responsive UI (desktop, mobile, tablet) adhering to specific branding guidelines, including logos and text styling. Key features included:
- **Data Management**: Read and process Excel data, allow CRUD operations for shipment records. Use UUIDs for MongoDB.
- **Branding**: Integrate Arkas Lojistik logos, text styling (font, color, weight) matching brand identity.
- **User Interface**: Functional and beautiful UI using Shadcn/UI and advanced Tailwind CSS patterns. Dynamic, interactive dashboard cards for Toplam Kayıt, Bu Ay, and Toplam Tutar.
- **Data Display & Interaction**: Display shipments with date and day name, allow month selection to filter the main table and update dashboard stats, add Boş (empty) shipment type, and a Kod field for each record.
- **User Experience**: Editable and persistent user name/ID (Mehmet Yılmaz - Sicil: 12345), with their section aligned with the company logo.
- **Advanced Tracking**: Manual Sistem amount input for each record, alongside Toplam amount, with a color-coded Karşılaştırma (comparison) column (green for positive difference, red for negative, based on  logic).
- **Reporting**: Annual PDF export functionality for all records with customizable year selection (2023-2050), ensuring Turkish character support, proper formatting, and currency symbols.
- **Deployment & Distribution**: Explore options for Google Drive deployment and cross-platform native applications (Windows .exe, Mac .app, Android .apk).

-   
    -   **Importance**: This is the core FastAPI backend. It defines API endpoints for CRUD operations on shipment () data, handles Excel data processing, and interacts with MongoDB. It also includes Pydantic models for data validation and serialization.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial setup for handling  data, subsequent additions for 'Boş' type, 'Kod' field, and logic for searching/filtering data based on user requests. It also handles the initial Excel data upload and parsing.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Lists all Python dependencies required for the FastAPI backend.
    -   **Changes Made**:  was added for Excel file processing.
-   
    -   **Importance**: The main React component that constitutes the entire frontend application. It manages state, renders UI components, handles user interactions, and makes API calls to the backend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensive modifications throughout the trajectory.
        -   Initial UI for displaying and adding shipment data.
        -   Integration of Arkas branding (logo, text styling, colors).
        -   Implementation of responsive design logic (desktop, mobile, tablet views).
        -   Dynamic dashboard cards, clickable elements, and detailed views.
        -   User information display, edit functionality, and  persistence.
        -   Month/year selection logic for filtering and display.
        -   Addition of 'Boş' type and 'Kod' field to forms and tables.
        -   Implementation of the 'Sistem' column, comparison logic, and color coding.
        -   PDF export functionality using  with year selection.
        -   Numerous UI adjustments for alignment, spacing, and hover effects.
        -   Refactored input handling for user edit dialog.
-    and 
    -   **Importance**: Contains global and component-specific CSS, utilizing Tailwind CSS directives.
    -   **Changes Made**: Custom styling for branding, responsive adjustments, defining custom CSS variables for brand colors, styling for new features like the comparison column, sticky headers, and general UI/UX improvements.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Lists Node.js dependencies for the React frontend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added , ,  for PDF generation,  (though not heavily used yet for routing), ,  for mobile app plans.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Created as part of the plan for desktop application packaging with Electron.
    -   **Changes Made**: Only created, no functional code was added/modified within the trajectory.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Configuration file for Netlify deployment, created during the deployment discussion.
    -   **Changes Made**: Only created, no functional code was added/modified within the trajectory.

<pending_tasks>
- **Visible Backup/Restore Buttons**: The buttons were added but are not visible in the UI. This is the immediate next fix.
- **Cross-Platform Native Application Build**: The plan to build , , and  files using Electron and Capacitor has been discussed but not fully executed due to environment limitations.
- **GitHub Integration**: Setting up the project on GitHub to facilitate APK builds via GitHub Actions.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on implementing **backup and restore functionality** for the application's data. The user explicitly requested uygulama içine yedek alma için bir buton ve yedekleri geri yüklemek için bir buton eklermişsin (add a button to back up and a button to restore backups inside the application).

The AI engineer reported Edit was successful (Chat 545), indicating that the code for these buttons was added. However, the very next user message (Chat 546) was a bug report: butonlar görüşmüyor nerede (the buttons are not visible, where are they?). The AI engineer acknowledged this and stated, Özür dilerim! Sadece ikonları ekledim, asıl butonları henüz eklememişim. Hemen yedekleme butonlarını ekleyeceğim (I apologize! I only added the icons, I haven't added the actual buttons yet. I will add the backup buttons immediately).

This indicates that the current work involves **making the backup and restore buttons visible** on the frontend, as the initial implementation only added icons or placeholders, but not functional, visible buttons for user interaction. The AI engineer has identified the issue and is preparing to add the actual button components to the UI.

<optional_next_step>
Ensure the backup and restore buttons are properly rendered and visible in the UI.
