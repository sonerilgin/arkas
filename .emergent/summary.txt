The AI engineer successfully transformed an MVP Arkas Lojistik shipment tracking application into a feature-rich system. Initial enhancements focused on UI/UX, including backup/restore, data deduplication, multi-selection for bulk delete, global search, dark/light theme, and responsive design. A complex authentication system was briefly implemented but later removed due to user feedback, reverting to direct access.

Recent development cycles addressed specific user-requested UI and data management improvements: preventing name shortening, adding monthly totals at the bottom, and introducing a Yatan Tutar (Deposited Amount) column with associated date fields. This Yatan Tutar functionality was later decoupled from the main shipment records into its own management system with dedicated CRUD operations and a separate UI. Reporting capabilities were enhanced with year/month selection and integration of Yatan Tutar details. Throughout the process, the UI was refined based on user feedback, including font size adjustments and removal of summary statistics. The final task in this trajectory involved successfully removing the Made with Emergent branding badge after several iterations and a cache refresh. The application is now in a state where core features are stable, and data management is more modular.

The Arkas Lojistik - Nakliye Takip Sistemi is a full-stack application for tracking and managing shipments from an Excel source. It needs a modern, responsive UI (desktop, mobile, tablet) adhering to Arkas branding. Core features include CRUD operations for shipment records, dynamic dashboard statistics (Total Records, This Month, Total Amount), month-based filtering, Boş type, Kod field, Sistem comparison column with color-coding, and PDF export with year selection. Recent enhancements added backup/restore with duplicate prevention, multi-selection for bulk delete, global search, and a dark/light theme. The authentication system was removed for simplicity. Latest requirements included preventing name shortening, displaying monthly totals for Toplam and Sistem at the bottom of the table, and adding a Yatan Tutar (Deposited Amount) column with a corresponding Yatış Tarihi (Deposit Date) and Çalışma Tarih Aralığı (Work Date Range). This Yatan Tutar functionality was later separated into an independent management system, displayed on the homepage dashboard, and integrated into advanced PDF reports. Further refinements involved UI adjustments for month card font sizes and removal of specific summary totals (average, all-time totals). The user also requested a custom circular logo for the application across all operating systems and removal of Made with Emergent branding.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a user request to remove the Made with Emergent branding badge from the application. This involved locating and removing the relevant HTML and JavaScript code responsible for rendering the badge, primarily within . After an initial removal attempt that the user reported as unsuccessful, likely due to caching, the frontend was restarted, and a subsequent screenshot confirmed that the badge was no longer visible. This task appears to be concluded, ensuring the application is fully branded as Arkas Lojistik without external branding. The system is now in a state where recent UI/UX improvements (separated Yatan Tutar management, updated reports, adjusted dashboard elements) and branding requirements are met.
