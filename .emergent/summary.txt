The AI engineer's work began by taking over an Arkas Lojistik shipment tracking application, initially focusing on UI/UX enhancements and separating the Yatan Tutar feature. The core of the trajectory then shifted to resolving persistent Android download issues, which proved challenging. Multiple approaches were attempted: direct  downloads, Web Share API with various fallbacks, and even a server-side file generation and download system. Each approach encountered platform-specific restrictions or introduced regressions on other platforms, leading to user frustration and further debugging.

Concurrently, a request to add multi-selection for Yatan Tutar records was addressed, involving UI updates and new state management, but this feature faced event handler binding issues before the user redirected focus back to the critical download problems. The latest major iteration involved implementing a QR code-based sharing mechanism, where the application would generate a temporary server-side URL for the file and display it as a QR code. This is the task that was immediately in progress before this summary. The AI also provided detailed guidance for manual APK build due to environment limitations.

The recurring theme is the difficulty in achieving reliable file downloads across all platforms, especially Android, due to browser security restrictions and PWA limitations, which necessitated a transition to server-side solutions and alternative sharing methods like QR codes.

<product_requirements>
The Arkas Lojistik - Nakliye Takip Sistemi is a full-stack application for tracking and managing shipments from an Excel source, requiring a modern, responsive UI. Initial requirements included CRUD operations, dynamic dashboard statistics (Total Records, This Month, Total Amount), month-based filtering, and PDF export with year selection. Enhancements added backup/restore with duplicate prevention, multi-selection for bulk delete, global search, and a dark/light theme. Authentication was removed for simplicity. Later, preventing name shortening, displaying monthly totals at the bottom of the table, and adding a Yatan Tutar (Deposited Amount) column with corresponding dates were requested. This Yatan Tutar functionality was then separated into an independent management system, integrated into the dashboard, and advanced PDF reports. Further refinements involved UI adjustments for month card font sizes and removal of specific summary totals. Custom circular logo and removal of Made with Emergent branding were also completed. The immediate problem being solved is the inability to reliably download PDF and backup files across Android and desktop platforms, and to provide an Android installation file (APK).

-   
    -   **Importance**: Core FastAPI backend, handles shipment and 'yatan tutar' data, MongoDB interaction. Now also handles server-side PDF and backup generation/temporary file hosting.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial  Pydantic models and CRUD endpoints. Later, new endpoints were added (, , , , ) for server-side PDF generation (using ) and JSON backup, including temporary file storage and retrieval for QR code sharing. Fixed  and encoding issues.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Python dependencies.
    -   **Changes Made**: Managed dependencies, including  related ones for server-side PDF generation.
-   
    -   **Importance**: Main React component, central logic for UI, state, and API calls.
    -   **Changes Made**: **Extensive**. Implemented Yatan Tutar separation, reporting enhancements, login screen logic. Crucially, underwent numerous iterations for file download functionality: initially direct Blob/link.click(), then Web Share API/Clipboard fallback, then direct simple download, then server-side download via dedicated FastAPI endpoints, and finally, a QR code-based sharing system utilizing temporary server-side URLs. Also implemented Yatan Tutar multi-delete checkboxes and related state/functions (though with unresolved event handler issues). Added state for QR code dialog and display logic.

- **Android File Download Reliability**: The current QR code solution for Android is in progress, with the backend temporary URL generation implemented, and the frontend logic for  and  updated to use these new endpoints for QR code display. It has not yet been fully tested with the new approach for QR code, which means the issue is still not resolved.
- **Yatan Tutar Multi-Delete Feature**: UI components are in place, but event handler binding issues were detected by the test agent and were not fully resolved when the user pivoted to download issues.
- **Cross-Platform Native Application Build (APK/EXE/APP)**: Multiple attempts to build an Android APK within the environment failed due to system resource limitations and missing SDKs. The AI provided guidance for local manual builds and suggested alternative methods (PWA, online builders, GitHub Actions), indicating this task is not completed by the AI.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on resolving the persistent Android file download issues by implementing a QR code-based sharing mechanism. The previous attempts to directly download files on Android (via client-side methods and even server-side HTTP FileResponse) were unsuccessful.

The current approach involves:
1.  **Backend Changes**: New FastAPI endpoints (, , ) were added to . These endpoints generate PDF/JSON files, store them temporarily on the server, and return a unique URL for access.
2.  **Frontend Changes**: The  library was added. The  and  functions in  were modified to:
    *   Call the new backend temporary file generation endpoints.
    *   Receive the temporary download URL from the backend.
    *   Display this URL as a QR code in a dedicated dialog ().
3.  **State Management**: New React states (, , ) were added to control the QR code dialog.

The AI engineer has just finished updating the frontend  and  functions to utilize these new temporary URL endpoints for QR code generation. The  function was the last one confirmed to be updated. The previous test of the QR code (where it tried to embed the entire file data) failed due to data size limits, so this new approach aims to address that by embedding only a URL. The task is currently at the stage of implementing this new QR code strategy, with  being the last function edited.
